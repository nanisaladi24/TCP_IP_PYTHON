### Important info on TCP - TIME_WAIT status:
'''

Running an example several times with too small delay between executions, could lead to this error:

socket.error: [Errno 98] Address already in use
This is because the previous execution has left the socket in a TIME_WAIT state, and canâ€™t be immediately reused.

There is a socket flag to set, in order to prevent this, socket.SO_REUSEADDR:

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
s.bind((HOST, PORT))

the "SO_REUSEADDR" flag tells the kernel to reuse a local socket in TIME_WAIT state, without waiting for its natural timeout to expire.
